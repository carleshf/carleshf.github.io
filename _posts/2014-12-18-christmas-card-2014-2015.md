title: Christmas Card 2014 - 2015
---

As the previous years, I continued with the tradition of sending a geed Christmas Card to my workmates. This year I wrote it in R, since it is one of the most used languages at CREAL.

 The result of running the script I sent (just a source code that loaded a file on the cloud) is seen above. The source code for that can be found at my christmas-card's github ([link](https://github.com/carleshf/christmasCards)) as ``mc201415.R``.

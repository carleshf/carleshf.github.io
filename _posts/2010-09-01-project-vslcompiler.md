## Summary

This is a personal project built while I took two subjects on "compilers". The goal was to develop a very simple grammar (I called it VSL or very simple language) and a compiler to .net CIL language.
I did this project long time ago (more than 8 years). 

My current TODO is rescue the posts I wrote about it and properly set-up the repository with all the information I can.

## Material

The code can be found at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/carleshf/vslcompiler).

I wrote four posts about `VSLcompiler`:

* [Building a Compiler in .Net (1 of 4)]({{baseurl}}building-a-compiler-in-net-1-of-4/)
* [Building a Compiler in .Net (2 of 4)]({{baseurl}}building-a-compiler-in-net-2-of-4/)

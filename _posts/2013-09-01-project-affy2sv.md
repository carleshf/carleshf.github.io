## Summary

The well-known Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) had led to many scientific discoveries using SNP data. Even so, they were not able to explain the full heritability of complex diseases. Other structural variants like copy number variants or DNA inversions, either germ-line or in mosaicism events, are being studies. `affy2sv` is an R package to  pre-process Affymetrix CytoScan HD/750k array (also for Genome-Wide SNP 5.0/6.0 and Axiom) in structural variant studies.

## Results

The R package is available at Bitbucket:

* Repository: [link](https://bitbucket.org/brge/affy2sv)
* Wiki: [link](https://bitbucket.org/brge/affy2sv/wiki/Home)

The project resulted in a publication at **BMC Bioinformatics**:

## Summary

The rexposome project is a set of R packages developed at Bioinformatics Research Group in Epidemiology (BRGE) from Barcelona Global Health Institute (ISGlobal). The project aims to provide a framework to incorporate exposome data in R/Bioconductor pipelines, with the goal of describing and analyzin exposome data. Currently, the Bioconductor packages included in rexposome project are rexposome and omicRexposome. The first package, rexposome, offers an interface to load exposome data into Bioconductor-like objects and functions to describe and characterize the exposome. It also includes functions to perform Exposome-Wide Association Studies. The second package, omicRexposome, contains functions to perform exposome-omic association studies and multi-omic integration of exposome and omic data-sets.

## Results

`rexposome` R package can be found into Bioconductor:

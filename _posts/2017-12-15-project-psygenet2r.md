## Summary

`psygenet2r` is an R package for gaining insight on the molecular basis of psychiatric disorders and their comorbidities. `psygenet2r` imports data from [PsyGeNET database](www.psygenet.org), a knowledge resource on psychiatric disorders and their genes, to be used with other R packages. `psygenet2r` also implements several functions to visualize and analyze the results in a clear and meaningful way.

## Results

This project published an R package in Bioconductor:

* Bioconductor: [link](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/psygenet2r.html)

And with a publication in **Bioinformatics** [(Open Access)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/24/4004/4083576):

It is the time to follow the tradition of creating a  _geek christmas card_. As I did last year, the one for this year is typed it in __javascript__. It is much simpler compared to the _game_ of the 2016 Christmas, but I enjoyed coding it.

No picture this time, only the link to it: [Merry Christmas 2017-2018](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/carleshf/christmasCards/blob/master/mc201718.html)

The card is a __HTML5__ canvas used as a grid where different _pixelled_ cartoons appears being drawn pixel-a-pixel. I have coded five different patterns. The source code for that can be found at my christmas-card's github [link](https://github.com/carleshf/christmasCards).

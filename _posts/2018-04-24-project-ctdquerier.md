## Summary

The CTDquerier R/Bioconductor package allows users to query CTD by gene, by chemical and by disease using single or multiple terms. The terms are validated against the CTD vocabulary used to download the multiple results from CTD as TSV files. The TSV files are read as DataFrames and once encapsulated in an S4 object of class `CTDdata`. Three methods are provided for `CTDdata` objects: (i) `get_terms` retrieves the terms that are validated in CTD vocabulary files; (ii) `get_table` fetches data from CTD as an object of class `DataFrame`; and (iii) `enrich` performs a Fisherâ€™s exact test between two `CTDdata` objects.

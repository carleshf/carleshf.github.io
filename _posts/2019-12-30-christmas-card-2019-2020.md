For this Christmas, I wanted to move the level of the _geek christmas card_ further that I did before.

The previous _gamified_ _GCC_s were based on a couple of smartphone games. For instance, the one for [2018-2019](https://carleshf.github.io/christmas-card-2018-2019/) was based on a game called [Tomb of the Mask](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playgendary.tom&hl=en) and the first on I _gamified_, [2016-2017](https://carleshf.github.io/christmas-card-2016-2017/), was based on [FlappyBird](https://flappybird.io/).

This time I wanted to come back in time and bring back an old point-and-click game-system that I played in [Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Sandiego#Where_in_the_World_Is_Carmen_Sandiego?_(1985,_1996)) and [Where in the space is Carmen Sandiego?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Sandiego#Where_in_Space_Is_Carmen_Sandiego?_(1993)).

So, for this year I codded the "Who stole the Christmas from Noth Pole?". It follows the same rules as the _Carmen Sandiego_ games and the goal is to collect the clues to identify the thief as well as to be in the city he/she is hiding.

You can get both the code and play the GCC [here](http://carleshf.github.io/christmasCards/mc/mc201920.html).

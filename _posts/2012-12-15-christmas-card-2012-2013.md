title: Christmas Card 2012 - 2013
---

This year I've decide to end a Christmas's card to my class mates. And as we are a bunch a little weird, and I'm not an exception, here you have the postcard I sent them: A source-code-postcard in python.

The result of running the script is this:

![Merry Christmas 2012-2013]({{baseurl}}/assets/mc201213.png)

You can see the gallery of cards [here](https://carleshf.github.io/christmasCards/) and you have the source code [here](https://github.com/carleshf/christmasCards).

## Summary

The goal of my final degree project was to develop an application (C/C++) to cross the classification obtained from clustering methods on a microarray dataset and the curves obtained from PCOP analysis of the same microarray (PCOP used to analyze gene co-expression). A web application, `CrossingClusters`, was developed to analyze and visualize the results.

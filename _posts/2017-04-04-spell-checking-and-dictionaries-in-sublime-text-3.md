I was a fan of the package `Dictionaries` but is seems that it is no available and that will not be re-included. The package's page in __package control__ is [here](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Dictionaries), indicating that the package was removed.

Anyway, the package is in [GitHub](https://github.com/titoBouzout/Dictionaries) and it can be installed from the repository. The steps follows:

  - Download the package as a ZIP file
  - Open a terminal on your `Downloads` folder
  - Unzip the file with `unzip Dictionaries-master.zip`
  - Rename the folder in a more suitable name with `mv Dictionaries-master Dictionaries`
  - Move the unzipped content to you package-folder with `mv Dictionaries ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages`

The steps described here are also in the package's repository (at the end).

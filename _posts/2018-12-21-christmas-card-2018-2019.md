title: Christmas Card 2018 - 2019
---

Following the tradition , I've made the _geek christmas card_ for this year. As it is being the trend lately, it is coded in __javascript__ and __HTML5__.

The card is, again, a _minigame_ where Mike 'the elf' has lost the present he crafter for this Christmas and we need to help him to find them all.

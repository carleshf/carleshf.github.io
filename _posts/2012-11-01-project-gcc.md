## Summary

The project *Geek Christmas Card* is a personal project I started during my master studies in bioinformatics. The goal is to create one *geek* card per year and send it to friends and work-mates.

Access to the Geek Christmas Cards gallery [here](https://carleshf.github.io/christmasCards/).

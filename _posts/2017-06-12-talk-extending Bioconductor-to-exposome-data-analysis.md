### Abstract

Exposome encompasses all environmental factors from conception until old age. Due to the ever changing
environment and habits, exposure to environmental contaminants is growing increasingly complex. The
HELIX ‘early-life exposome’ approach involves combining all environmental hazards that mothers and
children are exposed to, and linking this to the health, growth and development of the children.

The main objectives of HELIX project include the measurement of a wide range of chemicals and physical
environmental hazards in food, consumer products, water, air, noise, and the build environment. Also
to define a multi-pattern and individual exposure variability while determining a molecular profile and
biological pathways associated with those multiple exposures. To this end, a Bioconductor package has
been developed. The package incorporates functions for exploring exposome and its interaction with
outcomes, its integration with different omic data as well as downstream analyses to facilitate biological
insights though pathway analyses and retrieving data from public databases such as DisGeNET and
Comparative Toxicogenomics Database.

The usefulness of the package will be illustrated by analysing data belonging to the HELIX’s Spanish
cohort where exposome, genome, transcriptome, methylome and proteome data is available joint with
information about respiratory and neurocognitive outcomes.

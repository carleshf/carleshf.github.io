I am a Research Fellow / Bioinformatic Analyst at the Computational Health Informatics Program, located at [Boston Children’s Hospital](https://www.childrenshospital.org). My research interests include the study of the relations between environmental factors and internal omic perturbations, development of applications to integrate multiple layers of omic data-sets and web development of databases.

I am member of Dr. Kong’s group and I am currently working with the exogenous and endogenous exposures data-sets and their integration with gene expression of the [AutismExposome Project](http://autismexposome.org/).

I still collaborate with the [Bioinformatic Research Group in Epidemiology](http://brge.isglobal.org/) from [Barcelona Institute for Global Health](https://www.isglobal.org/) were I support the omic data analysis in the [European project HELIX](http://www.projecthelix.eu/).
